 * WHAT IT MEASURED (2026-09-18, with the BIOS defines):
 *
 *     scene          refresh    frame covered
 *      40 strokes     50 Hz          5%
 *     127 strokes     50 Hz         14%
 *     300 strokes     50 Hz         38%
 *     127 strokes     free          91%
 *     300 strokes     free          91%
 *
 * And that is where this thing's one rule of use comes from: A GAME WITH SAMPLES
 * RUNS AT FREE REFRESH. With a fixed refresh, `ritmo_vecfever` spends the frame's
 * leftover on its zero-reference alternation — where the ramp is deliberately OPEN
 * and Port A is the discharge current, so nothing can be injected there — and what
 * is left of drawing is a fraction of the frame that also changes with the scene:
 * the audio would fade in and out with whatever is on screen. With free refresh
 * there is no leftover, the list is drawing end to end and the coverage is 91%
 * whatever the scene. The cartridge BIOS already compiles this way (build.rs:
 * UVM2_HZ=0); a .um2 image asks for it with `make uvm2 UVM2_HZ=0`.
