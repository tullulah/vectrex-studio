/* ── THE VOLUME REGISTER IS LOGARITHMIC, AND THAT WAS THE CRUNCH ────────────
 *
 * Writing a linear PCM value into the PSG's volume register assumes the register is a
 * linear DAC. It is not: it is an ATTENUATOR built from a resistor ladder, and its
 * steps are roughly logarithmic. Derived from the ladder MAME uses for the AY-3-8910
 * (`ay8910_param` in ay8910.cpp, RL=1000), normalised:
 *
 *     level    5      8      10     12     15
 *     output  0.059  0.159  0.356  0.564  1.000
 *     linear  0.333  0.533  0.667  0.800  1.000
 *
 * So the value we called the midpoint actually sits at a sixth of full scale, and a
 * linear ramp comes out squashed at the bottom and stretched at the top — harmonic
 * distortion on every sample, independent of the mixer and of the sample rate. Traced
 * on hardware the DAC was emitting 5..10, i.e. 0.06..0.36: the whole signal living in
 * the bottom third of the curve.
 *
 * This table inverts it: index by the LINEAR value you want, get the level whose real
 * output is nearest. Collisions in the top half are the log curve's doing and are
 * honest -- fewer distinct levels, but at the right amplitudes.
 *
 * IT IS APPLIED AT THE LAST MOMENT, AFTER MIXING, and that is the whole reason it
 * lives here and not in the converter. Mixing has to happen in the linear domain; a
 * file holding pre-distorted levels would make summing two voices a sum of logarithms,
 * which means nothing. */

 *   values out of sixteen. Two usable bits. Daniel heard it exactly: still crunchy,
 *   and the ship roar still inaudible — not clipped away this time, buried under the
 *   quantisation noise of its own tiny amplitude.

     * transient clipping at a few percent is cheap, and amplitude is not. What made
     * it safe to spend is that the sources are compressed now (SHAPE in
     * wav_to_vsmp.py), so the clipped samples are peaks over a loud body rather than
     * the whole signal hitting a rail, which is what 11% sounded like.
     *
     * WHY THE DIVIDE STILL EXISTS AT ALL, rather than summing and letting the clamp
     * work: with a compressed bundle it stops being a close call. Never dividing costs
     * 13.2% of samples clipped — the plain sum that this file's first trace already
     * rejected at 11%. Four bits cannot hold five compressed voices at full body, and
     * pretending otherwise just moves the distortion somewhere louder.
     *
     * THE HISTORY IS KEPT BECAUSE EACH STEP WAS RIGHT ON WHAT IT COULD SEE, and the
     * shape of the mistake repeats. Two was first chosen when every sound reached the
     * DAC at full scale. Attenuating the beds in the bundle (the MIX table in
     * wav_to_vsmp.py) made that obsolete and three became correct — measured. Then
     * compressing the sources made THAT obsolete within the hour. The lesson is in the
     * first paragraph: this constant is not independent, and a number here that was
     * measured against a different .vsm is not evidence, however carefully it was
