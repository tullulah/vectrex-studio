/* uvm2_smp.h — digitised samples (.vsmp) through the PSG's volume DAC.
 *
 * The Vectrex has no audio DAC: the AY-3-8912 only makes square waves. A sample
 * is played by ABUSING one channel's 4-bit VOLUME register as a DAC — disable
 * that channel's tone and noise, then write amplitudes at the sample rate. It is
 * the trick behind Spike's voice, and `vinterface::dac_test` already measured it
 * on this console: it works, at around 8 kHz.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE SOLVES IS NOT THE DAC, IT IS THE BUS. Writing the PSG needs the
 * Vectrex bus, and the bus belongs to the beam: during a ramp Port A *is* the X
 * integrator's rate, so touching it deforms the stroke. Samples therefore cannot
 * be written "whenever due" from outside — they have to be INJECTED INTO THE
 * DRAW LIST, in the gaps where the beam is already parked.
 *
 * AND THOSE GAPS EXIST, MEASURED. A real stroke's list (tools/uvm2_anatomia.c
 * decodes one) is a chain of 32-bus-cycle micro-segments:
 *
 *     T1CL = 8      wait 0
 *     T1CH = 0      wait 11    <- the ramp runs here: T1 counts 8, there are 11
 *     PORT_A = 159  wait 3     <- already stopped: next segment's Y rate
 *     PORT_B = 0    wait 9     <- mux: sample Y
 *     PORT_B = 1    wait 0
 *     PORT_A = 97   wait 3     <- next segment's X rate
 *
 * Immediately before each `T1CL` the timer has expired, PB7 is high and the
 * integrators are frozen: a PSG write there does not move the beam. It costs four
 * commands (data, BDIR up, BDIR down, and RESTORING the X rate the coming ramp
 * needs) and there is one opportunity every 32 cycles — against the 187 that
 * separate two samples at 8 kHz. So there is always room, for about 2% of the bus.
 *
 * THE CLOCK IS THE BUS, NOT THE WALL. A list is BUILT one frame before it is
 * REPLAYED, and building it costs ~7 ms of the 20 it lasts: a wall clock read
 * while emitting does not say when the sample will sound. A command's position in
 * time is its position in bus cycles inside the list, which is what
 * `uvm2_ciclos_lista()` already counts — and that is why each voice's cursor
 * advances by ELAPSED cycles rather than one sample per emission. The pitch comes
 * out exact even though the opportunities fall unevenly: it is non-uniform
 * sampling with the right value at each instant, not jitter.
 *
 * THE INTER-FRAME GAP IS NOT A SPECIAL CASE, WHICH WAS NOT OBVIOUS. A game that
 * draws 12 ms of a 20 ms frame leaves 8 ms without strokes, and a DAC held there
 * would be a 50 Hz buzz. But that gap is ALREADY spent on commands:
 * `ritmo_vecfever` fills up to `uvm2_pacer_cycles` with its zero-reference
 * alternation, and each of its units carries its own `T1CL`. So the list covers
 * the WHOLE frame and injection is one thing in one place.
 *
 * AND THAT IS WHY ALL THE AUDIO LIVES IN THE CORE THAT BUILDS. Filling the gap
 * from the pacer step would have been the natural thing, and it would have been a
 * race: in dual core the pacer runs on the core that REPLAYS, not the one that
 * builds, and the two would have touched the voice cursors unarbitrated. There is
 * no shared state here to protect.
 *
 * THE HONEST LIMIT: WITH FREE REFRESH (UVM2_HZ=0) THE PITCH FOLLOWS THE DRAWING.
 * With no fixed rate there is no filling, the list is replayed and the next one
 * starts as soon as it is ready; if the builder is slower than the bus, the
 * executor sits idle and wall time passes with no bus cycles — and the sample
 * plays slow in that proportion. With UVM2_HZ=50 bus time and wall time are the
 * same by construction and the pitch is exact. A game that wants faithful audio
 * fixes its refresh; it is a trade you choose, not a fault you discover.

 * gap, and past the deadline it waits for the next one. Against a 6 kHz source that is
 * barely Nyquist, and the zero-order hold plus that jitter is audible as grain.
 *
 * Asking for twice the rate does not create detail the file does not have; it makes
 * the emitter take the FIRST gap after a much shorter deadline, so each value lands
 * closer to when it should and the steps are finer. It costs 4 commands per sample:
 * about 6% more bus cycles in the frame, which is affordable now that the frame is
